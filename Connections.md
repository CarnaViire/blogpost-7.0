# Improved handling of connection attempt failures

In versions prior to .NET 6, in case there is no connection immediately available in the connection pool, a new HTTP request will always spin up a new connection attempt and wait for it. The downside to this is, if it takes a while to establish that connection and another connection becomes available in the meantime, that request would continue waiting for the connection it spawned, hurting latency. In .NET 6.0 [we changed this](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/dotnet-6-networking-improvements/#other-http-changes) to process requests on whichever connection that becomes available first, whether thatâ€™s a newly established one or one that became ready to handle the request in the meantime.

Unfortunately, the .NET 6.0 implementation turned out to be problematic for some users: a failing connection attempt also fails the request on the top of the request queue, which  may lead to unexpected request failures in [certain scenarios](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/60654#issue-1030717005). Moreover, if there is a pending connection in the pool that will never become usable eg. because of a misbehaving server or a network issue, new incoming requests associated with it will also stall and may time out massively.

In .NET 7.0 we implemented the following changes to address these issues:

- A failing connection attempt can only fail it's initiating request, and never an unrelated one. If the original request has been handled by the time a connection fails, the connection failure is ignored ([dotnet/runtime#62935](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/62935)).
- If a request initiates a new connection, but then becomes handled by another connection from the pool, the new pending connection attempt will time out silently after a short period, regardless of `ConnectTimeout`. With this change, stalled connections will not stall unrelated requests ([dotnet/runtime#71785](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/71785)). Note that the failures of such "disowned" pending connection attempts will happen in the background and never surface to the user, the only way to observe them is to enable telemetry.
